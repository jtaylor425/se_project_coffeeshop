# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :

- There could be more styling effects for the inputs within the form block such as shading to give it more depth.
- the website also needs to be more responsive to varying screen sizes. The elements will bunch up if the dev tools are used or the window size is changed.
